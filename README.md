This is MyMusic app, which is basically a "Social platform" to share your music with friends. 
According to the lab requirements, the User will be able to:
1) Share their music with other people Via Facebook's API on Instagram stories;
2) Play music and show a notification that music is playing
3) When an AirPlane mode is turned on, it will notify user that the only oflline music will play
4) The app can check the userâ€™s calendar events and suggest music playlists based on upcoming events(like, if there is a GYM activity, the app will suggest Workout playlist)

// also check my insta @ioiiiomio(full process kinda)

Upd: 
1. I put all my mp3 files in the raw folder. Not in assets(I'm sure there's some minor difference but im used to using raw)
What works and what doesnt:
1) Music Player + Bonus
2) Online/Offline Check
3) Send Picture to Instagram(Kinda, the app doesn't recognize the instagram app for some reason)
4) Events(calendar intent) doen't work(I tried my best but nope)
